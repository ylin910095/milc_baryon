Instructions for downloading and building the Grid and Hadrons
packages for the "develop" branches for use with the MILC code.

Check the configure options for the desired build architecture in
build_Grid.sh and build_Hadrons.sh

Then run 
   ./build_Grid.sh scalar|avx512|avx2 PK_CC PK_CXX

On Cray systems, use PK_CC = cc and PK_CXX = CC.  Also, be sure the modules
include compiler, architecture (KNL), and MPI support.  For example,

PrgEnv-intel/6.0.4 
craype-mic-knl 
cray-mpich/7.6.2
